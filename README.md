# CIS5190 Final Project
## Advanced Stock Price Prediction Via Ensemble Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis
Our project aims to predict future stock price using two approaches - one year of stock price data and five years of stock price data and 13 models. 
There are two parts of code: the first part is the first year approach and the 7 models attached to it, and the second part is the five year approach and the 6 models attached to it.
